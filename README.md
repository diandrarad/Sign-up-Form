# Sign-up Form Project

## Introduction

This project involves creating a sign-up form for an imaginary service. The form includes various sections such as a background image, logo, and input fields for user registration. The project allows you to apply and practice your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript for form validation.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Set up and Planning

1. Set up your Git repository for version control.
2. Create HTML and CSS files, linking them correctly.
3. Add some simple dummy content to ensure proper setup.
4. Download the design file for reference and layout planning.

### Step 2: Gather Assets

1. Find and download a suitable background image for the large background section.
2. Select an external font for the 'logo' section.
3. Choose an image for the image-sidebar, replacing the default Odin logo.
4. Credit the creators of the background image and any external fonts used.

### Step 3: Implementation Tips

- Scaffold out the structure of the page first and then work on individual sections.
- Use a semi-transparent background for the "ODIN" logo section for improved readability.
- Choose a color for the 'Create Account' button that complements the background image (#596D48).
- Style input fields with a light border by default (#E5E7EB).
- Implement variations for password inputs (error class) and selected inputs (using :focus).
- Resize the browser to check responsiveness at different desktop resolutions.
- Consider implementing JavaScript for password field matching if confident, else validate fields separately.
